# SQL-Analysis-of-Parch & Posey

## Introduction
I queried the Parch and Posey paper company database using MySQL and PostgreSQL. Parch and Posey is an online papaer company that deals in the sales of different types of paper (Standard, Poster and Gloss). It is worthy to note that this dataset does not represent a real company. It was developed for the purpose of learning. 

The database consists of 5 tables namely:
- Orders
- Accounts
- Web_events
- Sales_reps
- Region

Below is the Schema of the database

## Analysis Process

I created the database in MySQL workbench for analysis. The query for creating the database can be copied from [Parch&Posey_database](https://github.com/Ratafar22/SQL-Analysis-of-Parch-and-Posey/blob/main/Parch%26Posey-database.sql) and you can load it into any server of your choice. Note: you might need to tweak the syntax to suit the database you are using.
